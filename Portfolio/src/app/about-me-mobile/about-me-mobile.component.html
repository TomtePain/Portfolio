        I am a Front-end developer based in Hennigsdorf, Brandenburg, Germany. I enjoy helping designers and companies
        bring their ideas
        into real life. I am looking forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web developer
        position. If you think Iâ€™d be a good match for your projects, contact me!

                I started programming for fun and out of interest and still enjoy programming. I quickly realized that I
                really enjoy it and that I would like to work in this field professionally in the future.

                This deep insight into programming made me realize that I had made exactly the right decision. I love
                developing web applications and facing new challenges. I believe that is the big thing in future!
